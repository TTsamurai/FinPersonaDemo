        <strong>Step 1: Personality Injection</strong>
        <p>
            In this initial step, you will choose the personality style for your financial advisor.
            Select either the <strong>Optimist (Friendly, Daring, Confident)</strong> or the 
            <strong>Pragmatist (Disciplined, Cautious, Practical)</strong> option. This choice will set the tone and approach of your advisor for the entire demonstration.

        <strong>Step 2: User Preference Elicitation</strong>
        <p>
            During this stage, the financial advisors will ask you a series of questions to gather insights into your investment preferences and needs.
            The information you provide will help guide the discussions and decisions in the subsequent stages.
            <strong>Review the assigned user narrative thoroughly and role-play as the investor described.</strong>

        <strong>Step 3: Personalized Stock Assessment</strong>
        <p>
            You will go through four rounds of financial discussions.
            Please move through the following sequence: 1: Discuss → 2: Discuss → … → 4: Discuss.
        </p>

            <h4 style="color: #6c63ff;">Discussion Phase (e.g., 1: Discuss)</h4>
            <p style="color: #34495e;">
                You will receive general instructions and information about a candidate stock, which has been <strong>randomly selected for this exploration</strong>.
                After reviewing the instructions, engage with the financial advisor to make your decisions.
                <strong>Once you feel that you have gathered enough information, proceed to the evaluation phase.</strong>
                Note that the candidate stock is <strong>not a recommendation</strong> from the advisor.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #6c63ff;">Next Round (e.g., 2: Discuss)</h4>
            <p style="color: #34495e;">
                After evaluating one stock, move to the next tab and repeat the process until all four stocks have been assessed.
