Growth stocks, on the other hand, are expected to experience rapid expansion in revenue and earnings, but may be more volatile. They often have a higher growth potential, but also come with higher risks. Think of it like buying a house: value stocks are like a stable, established home, while growth stocks are like a new, rapidly expanding development."}}
